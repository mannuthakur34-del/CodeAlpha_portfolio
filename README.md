# CodeAlpha_portfolio
This is a fully responsive and interactive personal portfolio website created as part of the CodeAlpha internship. The project showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and modern layout. The website is designed using HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
